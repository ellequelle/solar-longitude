# SaturnLs

SaturnLs converts between Saturn solar longitude, Ls, and date. It iterpolates ephemeris output by [JPL HORIZONS](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons) to convert between Ls and date with an error less than the day-to-day change in Ls. Functions are provided to convert among Ls, Gregorian calendar date, UNIX timestamp, and Julian date.
